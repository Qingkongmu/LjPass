# LjPass
Aiming at the problem of scarce labelling of panoramic image datasets under the urban planning domain, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptive method for panoramic image self-annotation work. A panoramic image dataset totalling 47758 images is constructed and open-sourced.
Here is the data from our open source dataset LjPass.
The repository consists of the raw panoramic image data we collected for the study area with the corresponding eight-bit color map labels generated using our method.
Currently uploading some demo tags for the time being, the full upload will follow!
